<b>Paper</b> plugin for selling areas (WorldGuard) using messenger (MySQL) with website.

To install this plugin for your computer and to build the plugin:

you need to install the stable version and build artifacts.
To build them, you need to load your project in  Intellij, then go to File->Project Structure, then go to Artifacts, click + at the top,
then choose JAR->From modules with dependencies. At the opened tab select the path (I made a path to server's plugin folder) and Include in project build.
