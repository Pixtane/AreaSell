# AreaSell
Bukkit plugin for selling areas (WorldGuard) using messenger (MySQL) with website.

To install this plugin for your computer and to build the plugin, you need to install the stable version and build artifacts.
To build them, you need to load your project in  Intellij, then go to File->Project Structure, then go to Artifacts, click + at the top,
then choose JAR->From modules with dependencies. At the opened tab select the path (I made a path to server's plugin folder) and Include in project build.
